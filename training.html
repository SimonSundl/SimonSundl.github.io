                    <li><strong>Passing</strong></li>
                    <p>Passing is probably one of the most important skills in football. To master the art of passing should be one of the main concerns 
                        of a football player, since football is a team game. You need to be able to pass well on any position. An attack often begins 
                        with a pass played by a defender or even the goalkeeper. In football you need to be able to decide in a very short amount of 
                        time which pass to play or prioritizing a pass over a shot on goal.
                    </p>
                    <li><strong>Shooting</strong></li>
                    <p>As mentioned in passing, a good footballer knows when to shoot and when to pass. Shooting is also an art in itself and often 
                        offensive players will bring that skill to good use. Defenders usually don't have as many opportunities as an attacker, but 
                        they still can be valuable for their team if they can land a good shot. Shooting techniques are different for almost every 
                        player, but everyone has to decide if they go for a well aimed shot or putting more power in it, which depends on the situation.
                    </p>
                    <li><strong>Dribbling</strong></li>
                    <p>Dribbling can also be a valuable skill. However to go for a dribble can be very risky, but rewarding if successful. To go for a 
                        dribble needs a good observation of the situation and high self esteem. When deciding to go for one, you should be sure it is 
                        successful and be wary of the consequences if gone wrong, a counterattack of the opposing team for example. Never go for dribbles 
                        if you just want to look fancy!
                    </p>
                    <li><strong>Many more</strong></li>
                    <p>There are many more skills needed for football like tackling, heading or to center a ball. If you're striving to be a very good 
                        player you need to be atleast decent in all of them. The advantage of football is, if you train a lot you'll get better in all 
                        of them since you need every single skill.

    <h2><a id="Fitness"></a></a>Fitness</h2>
        <p>
            Fitness is also a very important aspect of football. Since a game lasts for 90 minutes in most cases endurance is crucial to keep the 
            concentration up, so you'll still be useful for your team later on. I won't go into detail how to keep your fitness up, because most 
            clubs train atleast three times a week which should be enough to keep your fitness up. If you're not convinced the training is not 
            enough you can always go running, cycling, etc.

    <h2><a id="Tactic"></a></a>Tactic</h2>
        <p>
            Tactic plays a huge role in football. Most tactical decisions will be made by the head-coach or other coaches in the club. However a 
            player still needs to know of formations, where to move according to his position and much more. If a beginner steps on the field he 
            might be lost in many situations, but experience and training will help.
