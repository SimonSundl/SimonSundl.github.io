        Training is essential for becoming a good football player. Various methods for different skills are required. To find good balance between training and recovery
        is also an important part and plays a huge role wether you reach the peak of your powers at matchday.

    <h2><a id="Clubs and Leagues"></a></a>Clubs and Leagues</h2>
    <p>
        Naturally you'll need a club to play in a league and train with other players equally to your skill level. If you don't have one you should start to look
        around. Most places have a club of their own, so you could apply to a club near your home. However it is important to know where your limits are and 
        which league is fitting for you. Every region should have a website with their different leagues and clubs where you can check tables, statistics and much
        more. For my region, which is Styria (Austria), you can check out <a href="http://www.stfv.at" target=_blank>stfv.at</a> for the official website.

    <h2><a id="About me"></a></a>About me</h2>
    <img src="media/me.jpg" alt="Simon Sundl" class="img_small">
    <p>My name is Simon Sundl and I have been playing football since I was a little kid. Currently I'm playing football as a hobby 
        and my club is Tus Rein in Styria, Austria. The league I'm playing in is called the Oberliga Mitte, which is the fifth league 
        in Austria. I had intentions of playing in higher leagues when i was younger, but it didn't work out for me due to injuries. 
        This is why I went back to my "home" club where I don't have to invest as much time as in higher leagues and still can play 
        football at a decent level and have lots of fun at the same time.
