    <h1>Clubs and Leagues</h1>
    <p>
       Every county usually has multiple leagues filled with different clubs. For example in the league I'm playing in are 14 clubs 
       competing against each other. Most formats provide a club having a home and an away game against each club. 3 points are 
       awarded for a win, 1 point for each team for a draw and 0 points for a loss. Whoever is on top or bottom of the tables at the 
       end of a season, which roughly lasts a year, will either climb to the next league or need to play one league below. The first 
       club will win the title. <br>
       The higher the league you play the further you'll need to travel, even in other countries for the highest ones. However the 
       lower the league the shorther the travel, because leagues are formed for smaller areas and states. The highest league includes 
       the whole country of course, so keep that in mind. <br>
       To round things off I'll show you a short video of a penalty a teammate of mine missed, unfortunately. We still did come out on 
       top in the end though.
